# Gnome Attack 🧙‍♂️⚔️

A tower defense game where you defend against waves of evil gnomes using brave gnome defenders!

## Game Concept

- **5 lanes** where evil gnomes attack from the right side
- **10 columns x 5 rows** grid for placing defensive gnome towers
- **Wave-based gameplay** - survive increasingly difficult waves
- **Strategic placement** - position your defenders to maximize coverage

## Current Features

✅ Grid system (5x10 buildable positions)
✅ Tower placement system (left-click to place, right-click to remove)
✅ Gnome defender towers with attack logic
✅ Placeholder gnome sprites with fun designs

## Work In Progress

- 🚧 Enemy gnomes that move left across lanes
- 🚧 Wave spawning system
- 🚧 Combat system with projectiles and damage
- 🚧 Win/lose conditions

## Controls

- **Left Click**: Place a gnome defender on an empty grid cell
- **Right Click**: Remove a gnome defender
- **R Key**: Toggle attack range display

## Development

Built with GameMaker Studio 2
